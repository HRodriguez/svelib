	21 Ene:
		- threshold encryption
		
	+ Threshold private key generation
	- Threshold decryption
	- Threshold verifiable decryption
	
	- Save commitments to file
	- Load commitments from file
	- Load threshold private keys from file
	- Save partial decryptions to file
	- Load partial decryptions from file
	- task_monitor support for threshold key set-up? 
	
	- XML serializer ?
		
	Next week:
		- mixnets
		- proof of shuffling
		- verifiable decryption

Early optimization is the O(sqrt(n)*lg^2(n)) of all evil...


from utilities.BitStream import BitStream as BS
bs = BS()

s = ""
for i in range(0,100):
	s += "DEADBEEF"

num = int(s, 16)
bit_length = 4*8*100
bs.put_num(num, bit_length)

print [hex(c)[2:-1] for c in bs._cells]

Potential security issue:
	- Are votes with a fully 0'ed block in their plaintext detectable across re-encryptions?
	- Consider adding 1 to each block upon encryption and subtracting 1 on decryption (should work, since a block size is (nbits-1), encrypted block size is nbits, and we can encrypt any m < p)
