	21 Ene:
		- threshold encryption
		
	+ Threshold private key generation
	- Threshold decryption
	- Threshold verifiable decryption
	
	- Save commitments to file
	- Load commitments from file
	- Load threshold private keys from file
	- Save partial decryptions to file
	- Load partial decryptions from file
	- task_monitor support for threshold key set-up? 
	
	- XML serializer ?
		
	Next week:
		- mixnets
		- proof of shuffling
		- verifiable decryption

Early optimization is the O(sqrt(n)*lg^2(n)) of all evil...
