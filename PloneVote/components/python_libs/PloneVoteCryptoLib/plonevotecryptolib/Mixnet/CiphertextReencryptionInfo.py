#  CiphertextReencryptionInfo.py :
#
#  This file provides CiphertextReencryptionInfo, a class for storing the 
#  information used to re-encrypt a particular Ciphertext into another, namely 
#  the re-encryption coefficients (g^{r'}, y^{r'}) for each block of 
#  ciphertext. Given the two ciphertexts and this information, the fact 
#  that they both are different encryptions of the same plaintext can be 
#  verified without decryption.

class CiphertextReencryptionInfo:
	"""
	Stores the information used to re-encrypt a ciphertext into another.
	
	This class stores a list of re-encryption coefficients (g^{r'}, y^{r'}), 
	one for each block of ciphertext. Objects of this class are both indexable 
	and iterable, and behave as a list of pairs (g^{r'}, y^{r'}) when accessed 
	so.
	
	Given the two ciphertexts and the corresponding CiphertextReencryptionInfo 
	object, the fact that they both are different encryptions of the same 
	plaintext can be verified without decryption. If the origin ciphertext is 
	A, the re-encrypted ciphertext is B, and the reencryption info object is R, 
	then B[i] = R[i]*A[i] = (g^{r'}*gamma, y^{r'}*delta) for all i. This 
	comparison can be performed through the verify() method of this class.
	
	The new() class/static method can be used to generate a new random 
	re-encryption that can then be applied to a ciphertext through the 
	apply() method, resulting in the re-encrypted ciphertext.
	
	(See [TODO: Add reference] for more infomation).
