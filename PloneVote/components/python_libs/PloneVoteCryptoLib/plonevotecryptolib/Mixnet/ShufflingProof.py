#  ShufflingProof.py :
#
#  This file provides ShufflingProof, a class storing a verifiable 
#  Zero-Knowledge proof of correct shuffling between two ciphertext 
#  collections. Given two CiphertextCollection objects and their corresponding 
#  ShufflingProof, it can be verified that both collections contain 
#  re-encryptions of the same collection of plaintexts (including repetitions 
#  of the same plaintext). Additionally, this verification is done in 
#  Zero-Knowledge in the sense that the information contained within 
#  ShufflingProof objects does not reveal (fully or partially) the mapping of 
#  particular ciphertexts from the origin collection to the shuffled one.
#
#  Part of the PloneVote cryptographic library (PloneVoteCryptoLib)

class ShufflingProof:
	"""
	Stores the Zero-Knowledge proof of shuffling between two CiphertextCollection objects.
	
	This class contains a probabilistic Zero-Knowledge proof of equivalence 
	between a ciphertext collection and a collection obtained from it by a 
	shuffling operation.
	
	The recomended way to produce a shuffled CiphertextCollection from an 
	existing CiphertextCollection, together with their Zero-Knowledge proof of 
	equivalence (as a ShufflingProof object), is to use the 
	shuffle_with_proof() method of CiphertextCollection. 
	
	To verify (in Zero-Knowledge) that two collections are shown to be 
	equivalent by this proof, we use the verify(...) method of the proof, 
	passing it both the original and the shuffled collection. Of course, two 
	collections might be equivalent without the current ShufflingProof object 
	showing so, in which case verify(...) will return False for those 
	collections. ShufflingProof.verify(...), for any possible ShufflingProof 
	object, will not return True for two collections that are not really 
	equivalent, save with negligible probability.
	
	From within plonevotecryptolib.Mixnet, we can also use the new(...) class 
	method of this class to create a new proof of equivalence between 
	ciphertext collections A and B, providing both collections and a valid 
	CiphertextCollectionMapping between them.

	## SOME NOTES ON THE INTERNALS OF THIS PROOF:
	#
	# A shuffling/mixing proof is a probabilistic Zero-Knowledge proof in which 
	# the challenge is created non-interactively by means of the Fiat-Shamir 
	# heuristic. Practical explanation below, full explanation in:
	#
	#	Josh Benaloh, "Simple Verifiable Elections"
	# 	http://www.usenix.org/event/evt06/tech/full_papers/benaloh/benaloh.pdf
	#	[ToDo: Add own reference]
	#
	# This proof requires an integer security parameter P. 
	# In plonevotecryptolib, this parameter is taken from 
	#  params.SHUFFLING_PROOF_SECURITY_PARAMETER
	#
	# A ShufflingProof has three private fields:
	#
	#	* self._collections: A list of P collections, purportedly generated as 
	#	shuffles of the same original collection (the original collection we 
	#	wish to prove is equivalent to a particular shuffled collection)
	#
	#	* self._mappings: A list of P mappings (CiphertextCollectionMapping), 
	#	each either from the original collection into the ith element of 
	#	self._collections, or from that same element into the destination 
	#	shuffled collection we wish to prove equivalent (never both).
	#
	#	* self._challenge: A challenge stored as a string representing a 
	#	hexadecimal number, where, if b is the value of the ith bit of that
	#	number in binary representation:
	#		(b == 0) => self._mappings[i] is a mapping from the original 
	#			collection into self._collections[i].
	#		(b == 1) => self._mappings[i] is a mapping from self._collections[i] 
	#			into the destination shuffled collection.
	#	(Storing the challenge is not really necessary, but it can make some 
	#	diagnostics easier, allowing us to know what part of the proof failed.)
	#
	#
	# To generate a proof of shuffling (the new(...) method), between original 
	# collection O and shuffled destination collection D, with mapping M (O->D):
	#
	#	1) P CiphertextCollection objects, equivalent to O, are generated
	#	   (using new CiphertextCollectionMapping objects) and used to populate 
	#	   self._collections.
	#
	#	2) A fingerprint (SHA-256) of all involved collections, including O, D 
	#	   and those in self._collections, is generated as a challenge c.
	#
	#	3) We store c as self._challenge = c.
	#
	#	4) Using M, the mappings generated in (1), and the 
	#	   CiphertextCollectionMapping.rebase(...) operation, self._mappings is 
	#	   populated in accordance with self._challenge.
	#
	#	5) All information not stored in the fields self._collections, 
	#	   self._mapping and self._challenge is forgotten by the ShufflingProof 
	#	   object, so that the proof conveys no knowledge of the mapping M 
	#	   between O and D, other than that such mapping must exist.
	#
	# To verify the proof (the verify(...) method):
	#
	#	1) The challenge c is generated again.
	#
	#	2) self._challenge is verified to be c.
	#
	#	3) Each self._mapping[i] is verified to be a correct mapping from O to 
	# 	   self._collections[i] or from self._collections[i] to D, as dictated  
	#	   by self._challenge.
