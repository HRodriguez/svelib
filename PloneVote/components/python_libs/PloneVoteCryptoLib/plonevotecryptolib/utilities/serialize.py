"""serialize.py : A general serializer module for PloneVoteCryptoLib

This utility module provides serializer classes to store (serialize) and 
retrieve (deserialize) structured data from unstructured storage such as a file 
or a string. Each serialize class presents the same interface to callers, 
allowing for the format of serialized data (such as XML, JSON, etc) to be 
changed by simply changing the class of the serializer object used.

Because of python's dynamic nature, serializing and then deserializing 
arbitrary objects from untrusted storage (using, for example, the pickle 
module) is inherently dangerous. See http://nadiana.com/python-pickle-insecure

To solve this problem, serialize.py allows for the serialization of structured 
data. Each serializer object must, at construction, be provided with a 
structure definition dictionary, which constrains the form of the data that 
this object will serialize and deserialize.

A structure dictionary is a dictionary with string keys and tuple values. 
Each key names an element of the data to be serialized and each tuple describes 
how that element may appear in the data. The tuple consists of two integers and 
either None or another structure definition dictionary:

    * The first integer indicates the minimum number of times (min_occurrences) 
    that the element may appear in the serializable/serialized data.
    
    * The second integer indicates the maximum number of times 
    (max_occurrences) that the element may appear in the 
    serializable/serialized data.
    
    * The third element in the tuple may be None, indicating that the data for 
    that element must be textual data (a string); or a structure definition 
    dictionary, providing a recursive definition of that element (ie. the 
    element is formed of more elements). The first case is called a leaf or 
    string element, while the second is called a composite element.
    
The min_occurrences and max_occurrences values may be omitted from the tuple, 
in which case they are assumed to be 0. For max_occurrences, 0 means 
"any number of occurrences" or "infinite" (an actual requirement of a maximum 
of 0 occurrences would be absurd, so we can re-purpose this value).

The following are all valid ways of giving the tuple that defines the value of 
an element inside a serialize structure definition dictionary:

    (min_occurences, max_occurrences, None)
    (min_occurences, max_occurrences, {... #structure definition dict})
    (min_occurences, None)
    (min_occurences, {... #structure definition dict})
    (None)
    ({... #structure definition dict})

We now show a structure definition dictionary for a person with 1-n first 
names, 0-n middle names, 1-n last names and a single age*.

Example serialize structure definition dictionary:
    
    structure_definition = {
        "person" : (1, 1, {                 # Root element
            "names" : (1, 1, {              # 1 "names" node allowed, exactly
                "first" : (1, None),        # 1 or more first names allowed
                "middle" : (None),          # 0 or more middle names allowed
                "last" : (1, None)          # 1 or more last names allowed
            }),
            "age" : (1, 1, None)            # 1 age allowed, exactly
        }),
    }

The data to be serialized must be provided in the form of another dictionary, 
constrained by the corresponding structure definition dictionary. We call this 
dictionary a serializable data dictionary.

Each element in the serializable data dictionary must have the same name as an 
element in the structure definition dictionary (also at the same 'level'). Its 
value must be either:

    * A single string, if the element was defined to be a leaf element in the 
      structure definition dictionary and only one occurrence appears in the 
      data.
      
    * A serializable data dictionary matching the element's own structure 
      definition dictionary, if the element was defined to be composite and 
      only one occurrence appears in the data.
      
    * A list of either strings or serializable data dictionaries containing one 
      element for each occurrence of the element in the data.

The following is an example of a serializable data dictionary matching the 
previously given structure definition dictionary.

Example matching serializable data:

    data = {
        "person" : {
            "names" : {
                "first" : "Pedro",           # Note: no middle name
                "last" : [                   # Multiple last names
                    "Pérez",
                    "Hernández"
                ]
            },
            "age" : "42"
        }
    }
    
To serialize this data, one needs only create a new serializer object with the 
corresponding structure definition dictionary. For example, a XMLSerializer:
    
    serializer = XMLSerializer(structure_definition)
    
And pass the data to any of its serialize_to_X methods. Most serializers 
provide at least serialize_to_file and serialize_to_string:

    serializer.serialize_to_file(file_name, data)
    
To deserialize the data, one must use a serializer object of the same class, 
created with the same structure definition dictionary. Each serialize_to_X 
should have a corresponding deserialize_from_X method:

    recovered_data = serializer.deserialize_from_file(file_name)
    
The result of calling this method will be to recover the data (in serializable  
data dictionary form).

If the serialized data is invalid or does not match the expected structure 
definition, however, an InvalidSerializeDataError exception will be raised 
instead. This ensures that recovered data always meets the specified 
constrains, making it easier for the consuming code to quickly and safely 
reconstruct objects or configuration from a recovered serializable data 
dictionary.

* Yes, we are aware this is not how names work in the real world, all over the 
world, this is just a toy example.
