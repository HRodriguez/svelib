class ThresholdKeyPair:
	"""
	A threshold key pair object.
	
	Unlike KeyPair, this class does not generate the keys, but merely acts as a 
	tuple with named fields. Threshold key generation is done by the 
	ThresholdEncryptionSetUp class
	
	Attributes:
		public_key::PublicKey	-- The threshold public key
		private_key::PrivateKey	-- The threshold private key
