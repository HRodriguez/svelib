	Represents a polynomial for which we know the value of its coefficients.

	explicitly know all c_{i}'s.
	
	Only integer coefficients are supported by this class. Additionally, all 
	arithmetic for the polynomial is performed with a given modulus value. 
	This is natural, since all operations within an ElGamal cryptosystem occur 
	in the cyclic group Z_{p} of the integers modulus p.
