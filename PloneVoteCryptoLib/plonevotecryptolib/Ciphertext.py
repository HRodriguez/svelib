#  Ciphertext.py : A class to represent encrypted data within PloneVoteCryptoLib.
#
#  This class is mostly used to represent encrypted data in memory and to 
#  store/load that data to/from file.

#  Part of the PloneVote cryptographic library (PloneVoteCryptoLib)

## Note 001:
#
# By convention (followed across PloneVoteCryptoLib), before being encrypted, 
# all data is transformed into an array of bytes formated as follows:
#
# - The first 64 bits (8 bytes) are a long representation of the size of 
# the encrypted data ($size).
# - The next $size bits are the original data to be encrypted.
# - The rest of the array contains random padding.
#
#    [size (64 bits) | message (size bits) | padding (X bits) ]
#
# Note that this limits messages to be encrypted to 16 Exabits (2 Exabytes). 
# We deem this enough for our purposes (in fact, votes larger than a couple MB 
# are highly unlikely, and system memory is probably going to be a more  
# immediate problem).
